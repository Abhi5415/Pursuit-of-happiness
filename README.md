# Pursuit-of-happiness
I have created a simple computer game that establishes a poignant truth about the world. The harder one strives for happiness, the less prevalent it becomes in the world. This game is a version of the prisoner’s dilemma where any number of students reflect a society where each person is trying be as happy as possible on their own. Below is a diagram of the possible payouts.  Now, someone who is aspiring to be happier than others may decide to cheat once to get slightly ahead of the curve. However, this game is programmed to memorize each player’s move and will replicate it on the next round. In other words, every player is playing against the player before him/her and the first player plays against a randomly generated set of moves. Hence, every move in which a player cheats, introduces another cheat in the next round. At the end of the game, the total scores are added up and compared to the total attainable societal score. The harder each individual tries to deceive and outsmart the opponent, the more the society suffers as a whole. All in all, my creative piece aims to show the fleeting nature of societal happiness which only comes when all parties decide to cooperate.
